      <p>We  built  a  robot  able  to  navigate  autonomously  in  a  simulated  environment.
          To  process  visual  information  and  generate  the  corresponding  motor  actions,
          the  robot  relies  in  an  image  encoder  based  in  the  mammalian  retina.  For  this
          purpose,  the  encoder  was  used  as  an  input  for  an  evolving  neural  network  that
          was  trained  with  a  genetic  algorithm,  allowing  the  robot  to  learn  how  to  effi-
          ciently  avoid  objects.</p>

          <p>The  main  features  of  the  retina-inspired  encoder  are  a  Difference  of  Gaus-
          sians  (DoG)  spatial  filter  and  a  Difference  of  Exponentials  (DoE)  temporal
          filter,  to  mimic  the  ON-OFF  ganglion  cells  in  the  retina.  This  approach  allows
          the  detection  of  edges  and  movement  using  only  a  fraction  of  the  information
          contained  in  the  original  input  image.</p>

      <p>Compare the performance achieved by an autonomous robot while trying to avoid cubes randomly placed on a board, with two different ways of proccessing the visual information: in the first place with the raw image stream coming from a camera, and in the second place proccessing that same image with the proposed retina encoder.</p>

      <p>The performance is measured with two different kind of cubes, where one cube is made of a simple color, and the second one has texture and a figure on it. </p>

        <p>Also, there are two board layouts, where in the first scenerio the robot is placed in the middle of a board and has to cover as much distance as possible without hit any cube, and in the second scenario the robot has to get out of a maze.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Experiment</h1>
      <p>In the first experiment class, the robot is placed in the middle of a board with a lot of cubes placed randomly. The 
      robot gains fitness basically in terms of the distance covered in the simulation in any direction. The 
      simulation time is constant between simulations and all NEAT outputs are sent directly to the individual 
      wheels velocity. In all cases the robot is free to do whatever it wants in the simulation time, but when 
      it does a behavior that the experiment is worried about the fitness is penalized. All wheels are given a 
      minimum and maximum velocity.</p>

      <p>In the second experiment class, it was decided to use a new maze-like scene with cubes put randomly. The board was split into 5 different 
    zones with a growing difficulty, and the robot gets fitness while it is approaching to the finish zone. The robot detects the 
    collisions and gives the chance of recoiling for a little period of time so the cube can be put in the visual domain in case it was not seen by the 
    robot and gives the chance to recover. If the robot colides more than 2 times the fitness is punished and the time of simulation 
    decrease. If the robot is halted for more than a fixed period of time the simulation stops. The same happens if the robot is turning
    on its own axis longer than a desired time. The simulation time can increase if the robot is behaving the way we want but stops relatively 
    fast otherwise. There are experiments where NEAT and HyperNEAT were tested.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Improvements</h1>
      <ul>
        <p><li>The first change was to consider a maze with cubes put as obstacles.</li></p>
        <p><li>Any time the robot passes by an obstacle, the fitness increases in a sigmoid way.</li></p>
        <p><li>Collisions are given to the neural network so it can decide whether return or keep moving the same way. This is important because sometimes the robot hits a cube but nothing is at sight. This happens since the camera angle doesn't reach the wheels. It is up to the robot to decide what to do in those cases and it is given a short recoil time where the default speed settings are turned off.</li></p>        
        <p><li>The maze is divided by stages. Any stage gives increasingly different levels of reward to the robot. It was decided to put every horizontal row of the maze as a different stage. Any time the robot reaches a new stage the previous collisions are declined.</li></p>
        <p><li>The robot lose fitness if it doesn't go forward the stage.</li></p>
        <p><li>If the robot is stuck in the beginning the idea is that the simulation stops fast, but if the robot advance in the maze the simulation must last more. This is why any time the robot overtakes a new cube the simulation time increases. This happens only once per cube.</li></p>
        <p><li>If the robot crashes more than a defined number of times, the fitness decrease in a compound way and the simulation time decrease. The idea behind this is to end quickly simulation of robots that cannot avoid cubes but at the same time letting the robot hitting cubes by accident as a way of making out for the possible collisions with the cube out of sight.</li></p>  
        <p><li>There is a possibility of setting discrete speeds so that the robot has smaller free range.</li></p>
        <p><li>A maximum differential wheel speed was set. It was decided the robot to pivot when this threshold was reached.</li></p>
        <p><li>If the robot is halted for more than a fixed time span, the simulation stops. The same happens if the robot is pivoting more than another time threshold.</li></p>
        <p><li>The project was extensively documented and all the data can be easily processed with a python script. The project may be found in GIT and can be easily installed with everything needed.</li></p>
        <p><li>An anti wind-up mechanism was implemented in the maximum differential speed of the wheels.</li></p>
        <p><li>There are three new experiments, every one of them with all the already said improvements:
          <ol>
            <li>The two wheels are independent and the robot uses only NEAT</li>
            <li>There is a default speed and the direction is controlled by NEAT</li>
            <li>There is a default speed and the direction is controlled by HyperNEAT</li>
          </ol>
        </li></p>
        <p><li>It was used at the end of this internship the NEAT version made by <a href="https://github.com/pabloreyesrobles/">Pablo Reyes</a></li></p>
        <p><li>An HTML document was created to expose the project.</li></p>

      <ul>
        <p><li>Narrow the maze so that the robot must decide on going in "one route or the other"</li></p>
        <p><li>Adding a gyroscope so that the robot can know if it is going back in the maze.</li></p>
        <p><li>Fix random bugs related with NEAT and a mismatch size in population (sometimes the simulation ends earlier than expected).</li></p>
        <p><li>Problem running Champion. For some reason, when the champion is loaded, it doesn't behave like the actual champion but has a very bad performance instead.</li></p>
        <p><li>Look for a way of extending the camera angle of the robot. Maybe is the camera is placed further back in the robot's top, it could be possible to see the wheels while moving</li></p>
        <p><li>Find a way of improving the performance of the robot in the task of learning. A steeper curve should be expected in the average fitness. It should be tried to use higher generation numbers and see the performance for numbers greater than 30, as it was rendered in this document.</li></p>
